# MITRE ATT&CK

MITRE ATT&CK (Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge) is a knowledge base and framework used for describing the actions and behaviors of cyber adversaries. The framework is maintained by MITRE Corporation, a not-for-profit organization that operates Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDCs) in the United States.

## Purposes of ATT&CK Framework

The ATT&CK framework serves multiple purposes, including but not limited to:

1. **Cybersecurity Research**: Helps in studying various adversarial behaviors and methodologies.

2. **Incident Response**: Assists teams in understanding the scope, scale, and nature of an ongoing attack by mapping detected activities to the ATT&CK matrix.

3. **Threat Intelligence**: Aids in categorizing, describing, and sharing information about cyber threats.

4. **Security Operations**: Helps in identifying gaps in defensive coverage and improving detection and prevention mechanisms.


## Importance of the ATT&CK Framework

Although a US backed organization, MITRE is recognized as an authoritative source for all sorts of security information worldwide. The ATT&CK framework in particular is held as a standard for modeling the lifecycle and components of an adversary. It provides an organized view of the Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures employed by attackers, which can be used by organizations to focus their defense efforts and better understand the attack lifecycle.

## Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTPs)

TTPs stand for Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures. They are a set of concepts used in the field of cybersecurity to describe how adversaries operate during an attack. Each of the three components—tactics, techniques, and procedures—provides a different level of insight into an adversary's behavior and methods.

### Tactics

Tactics refer to the "what" or the objectives behind an adversary's actions. These are the high-level goals an adversary aims to achieve, such as gaining initial access to a network, maintaining persistence, or exfiltrating data. Tactics give a general idea of what the attacker is trying to achieve but don't delve into how they are doing it.

### Techniques

Techniques describe the "how" or the methods used to achieve a tactic. For example, if the tactic is to gain initial access to a network, techniques might include spear-phishing, exploiting a software vulnerability, or using stolen credentials. Techniques are more specific than tactics but are still somewhat high-level and can be carried out in various ways.

### Procedures

Procedures are the specific, step-by-step means by which techniques are executed. They are the "nuts and bolts" of the attack and could involve things like the specific software or code used in a spear-phishing email, or the sequence of commands used to exploit a particular vulnerability. Procedures are the most detailed and specific layer of the TTPs concept.

#### MITRE ATT&CK and TTPs

In the context of MITRE ATT&CK, TTPs are systematically categorized and linked to provide a comprehensive understanding of adversarial behavior, allowing cybersecurity professionals to identify, defend against, and mitigate cyber threats effectively.

## Pentest Case Study Organized According to MITRE ATT&CK

### Overview

This case study describes a penetration test conducted by ACME Security against a client's web application and internal network. The test aimed to identify vulnerabilities and weaknesses that could be exploited by adversaries. The findings are organized based on the MITRE ATT&CK framework to provide a structured view of potential attack paths and risks.

### Initial Access (Tactic)

#### Spear-Phishing (Technique)

##### Procedures

1. Crafting phishing emails disguised as notifications from IT support.
2. Including a malicious link to capture credentials.
3. Sending emails to selected employees.

#### Exploit Public-Facing Application (Technique)

##### Procedures

1. Identifying vulnerabilities in the web application using automated scanning tools.
2. Exploiting a SQL injection vulnerability to gain initial access to the database.

### Execution (Tactic)

#### Command-Line Interface (Technique)

##### Procedures

1. Using SSH to connect to an internal server.
2. Running commands to enumerate user accounts and network shares.

### Privilege Escalation (Tactic)

#### Bypass User Account Control (Technique)

##### Procedures

1. Using a known Windows UAC bypass technique to escalate privileges.
2. Gaining administrator access on the machine.

### Lateral Movement (Tactic)

#### Remote Desktop Protocol (Technique)

##### Procedures

1. Using stolen credentials to access another machine via RDP.
2. Installing a backdoor for persistent access.

### Data Exfiltration (Tactic)

#### Automated Exfiltration (Technique)

##### Procedures

1. Compressing sensitive files into a ZIP archive.
2. Uploading the ZIP archive to an external cloud storage service.

### Impact (Tactic)

#### Data Destruction (Technique)

##### Procedures

1. Deleting logs and files to cover tracks.
2. Running a script to wipe certain partitions as a demonstration of potential impact.

## Issues with ATT&CK

No framework is perfect and ATT&CK is not the exception. Although still the go-to model for many organizations, ATT&CK has some flaws and areas for confusion, including:

- **Bloat:** As attacker tactics have grown in scope and complexity, MITRE has added several Tactics to the framework over time. Several of these overlap and even have overlapping techniques. It can be difficult to understand the distinctions between similar techniques.
- **Overlap**: Several categories have clear overlap. For example, Command and Control and Exfiltration are functionally identical but are distinguished by their intent. This may cause confusion for newcomers.
- **Miscategorization:** Although generally well organized, some Techniques are lumped into categories they don't quite fit within. 
- **Outdated Techniques:** Changes to the framework are sometimes slow and Techniques can become outdated. For example, the standard ATT&CK does not comprehensively cover TTPs related to cloud environments. MITRE has addressed this through the Cloud Matrix, which duplicates many of the TTPs in the regular Enterprise ATT&CK.
- **Lack of Standard Metrics:** Although the framework provides a comprehensive way for modeling TTPs, there is no measurement component to the framework.
