## IPv4 (Internet Protocol Version 4)

IPv4 is the fourth version of the Internet Protocol, which identifies devices on a network through an addressing system. The IPv4 address space is limited, and it uses a 32-bit address to identify hosts and networks.

### Why IPv4?

1. **Widespread Adoption**: IPv4 is still the most commonly used IP version.
2. **Ease of Configuration**: It is easier to set up and manage compared to newer versions like IPv6.
3. **Compatibility**: Many existing systems and protocols were designed around IPv4.

### Basic Terminology

- **IPv4 Address**: A 32-bit numerical identifier for a device, represented in decimal as four octets separated by periods (e.g., 192.168.0.1).
- **Subnet Mask**: A 32-bit address used to separate the network and host portions of an IP address.
- **Default Gateway**: The IP address of the router that serves as the intermediate point between the local network and other networks.
- **CIDR Notation**: A shorthand for specifying IP addresses and subnet masks (e.g., 192.168.0.1/24).

### Private and Public Addresses

- **Private Addresses**: Reserved for internal network use and are not routable on the Internet (e.g., 192.168.0.1, 10.0.0.1).
- **Public Addresses**: Routable on the Internet and must be unique to prevent conflicts.

### Subnetting in IPv4

Subnetting is commonly used in IPv4 to divide a network into smaller, more manageable pieces. [Refer to the Subnetting section for more details](#subnetting).

### NAT (Network Address Translation)

NAT is a method used to map private IPv4 addresses to a public address. This allows multiple devices on a local network to share a single public IP address for accessing resources on the Internet.

### DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)

A protocol that dynamically assigns IP addresses to devices on the network. This is often used in conjunction with IPv4 for ease of network management.

### Limitations and the Transition to IPv6

- **Address Exhaustion**: The primary limitation is the exhaustion of the available address space.
- **Complexity and Overheads**: Due to the use of techniques like NAT, there can be complexities and overheads that IPv6 aims to solve.

IPv4 remains a fundamental part of most networks, but it's important to consider future-proofing with IPv6 due to the limitations of the IPv4 address space.



## Routing

Routing is the process by which data packets are forwarded from one network segment to another, typically passing through a variety of intermediate devices like routers and switches. It is one of the essential mechanisms that make networks and the Internet functional.

### Why Routing?

1. **Path Selection**: Routing algorithms determine the best path for data to reach its destination.
2. **Scalability**: As networks grow, it becomes impractical to manually define pathways for data. Dynamic routing algorithms scale effectively with the network.
3. **Fault Tolerance**: Dynamic routing protocols can adjust to changes in the network topology, like a device failure, to find a new optimal path.

### Basic Terminology

- **Router**: A device that connects multiple networks and routes data packets between them.
- **Routing Table**: A database in the router that stores various routes to known networks.
- **IP Routing**: The process of sending packets from a source network to a destination network based on IP addresses.
- **Gateway**: A router that serves as the access point to pass data in and out of the network.

### Types of Routing

#### Static Routing
Manually configured routes that don't change unless updated by a network administrator. Suitable for small networks but lacks scalability.

#### Dynamic Routing
Routes are automatically updated using routing protocols. This is more scalable and fault-tolerant but can be more complex to set up.

- **RIP (Routing Information Protocol)**: An older, distance-vector routing protocol.
- **OSPF (Open Shortest Path First)**: A common link-state routing protocol used in large enterprise networks.
- **BGP (Border Gateway Protocol)**: The protocol used to make core routing decisions on the Internet, involving thousands of autonomous systems.

### Routing Metrics

These are factors considered by routing algorithms to determine the best path for data to travel:

- **Hop Count**: Number of devices a packet must pass through.
- **Bandwidth**: Data carrying capacity of the link.
- **Latency**: Time it takes for a packet to go from source to destination.
- **Cost**: An arbitrary value that can be based on various factors like speed, reliability, or other administrative settings.

### Example: How Routing Works

1. A device in Network A wants to send data to a device in Network B.
2. The source device sends the data packet to its local gateway (Router A).
3. Router A checks its routing table to find the best path to Router B, the gateway for Network B.
4. The packet may pass through multiple intermediate routers before reaching Router B.
5. Router B forwards the packet to the destination device in Network B.

Routing is essential for any complex network and understanding its basics is crucial for network design, troubleshooting, and management.

## Subnetting

Subnetting is the practice of dividing a network into smaller, more manageable segments, or "subnets." This enhances network performance, security, and simplifies management. Below are some key concepts and practices involved in subnetting.

### Why Subnetting?

1. **Efficient IP Address Allocation**: Subnetting allows for more efficient use of IP addresses by dividing a network into smaller segments, thereby reducing waste.
2. **Security**: Creating different subnets can isolate parts of a network, limiting the impact of a compromised system within one subnet.
3. **Improved Performance**: By separating segments of a network, local traffic stays local, reducing congestion.

### Basic Terminology

- **CIDR Notation**: Stands for "Classless Inter-Domain Routing" and is used to define the subnet mask. For example, in `192.168.0.1/24`, the `/24` indicates the first 24 bits are used for network identification.
- **Subnet Mask**: A 32-bit address used in IPv4 to separate the network portion from the host portion. Commonly represented as four octets, like `255.255.255.0`.
- **Network Address**: The first address in a subnet, usually reserved and not assigned to any host.
- **Broadcast Address**: The last address in a subnet, used for sending data to all hosts in the subnet.
- **Host Range**: The range of addresses between the Network Address and Broadcast Address, assignable to individual devices.

### Steps to Create a Subnet

1. **Define Requirements**: Determine the number of subnets and hosts per subnet you need.
2. **Choose Subnet Mask**: Select a subnet mask that provides enough host addresses for each subnet.
3. **Divide Network**: Break your network into the defined subnets.
4. **Assign Addresses**: Allocate specific IP address ranges to each subnet.

### Calculating Subnets

1. **Subnet Mask Calculation**: To find out how many bits are needed for the required number of subnets or hosts, you can use the formula \(2^n\), where \(n\) is the number of bits. For example, to create 4 subnets, you'd need \(2^2 = 4\) bits.
2. **New Subnet Mask**: Add the number of bits needed to the original subnet mask. For instance, if the original mask was `/24` and you need 2 bits for 4 subnets, the new mask becomes `/26` (`255.255.255.192`).

### Example

Let's say we have a network with address `192.168.1.0/24` and we need to create 4 subnets.

1. **New Subnet Mask**: `/24 + 2 = /26` (or `255.255.255.192`)
2. **Subnets Created**: 
  - `192.168.1.0/26`
  - `192.168.1.64/26`
  - `192.168.1.128/26`
  - `192.168.1.192/26`

Each subnet now supports 62 hosts (64 total addresses minus network and broadcast addresses).
