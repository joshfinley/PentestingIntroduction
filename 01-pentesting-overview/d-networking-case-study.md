# Case Study: Example Enterprise Network Architecture

## Introduction

This case study explores the network architecture of AcmeCorp, a fictitious enterprise. The network is designed to support various departments, including Engineering, Marketing, and Sales, along with administrative staff. It consists of multiple elements such as a border router, internal subnets, VLANs, and DNS servers.

## Data Flow Overview

### Data Center to Core Switch

1. **Initial Transmission**: Servers in AcmeCorp's data centers initiate the transmission of data. These could be application servers, database servers, or any other types that need to communicate externally.
   
2. **Local Switch**: Each data center has its own local switch. Servers are connected to these switches, which route traffic either within the data center or outward.

3. **Core Switch**: From the local switch, the data packets are sent to a core switch that serves as the main control hub for traffic coming from different departments and the data centers.

### Core Switch to Border Router

1. **VLAN Routing**: At this stage, VLAN tags are checked, and traffic is directed accordingly. For example, Engineering's VLAN 10 data packets will be sent along a different path compared to Marketing's VLAN 20 packets.

2. **Firewall**: Before reaching the border router, the data packets pass through a firewall. This firewall filters the packets based on pre-defined security rules, blocking or allowing data to pass through to the border router.

### Border Router to ISP Backbone

1. **NAT (Network Address Translation)**: One of the most critical roles of the border router is to perform NAT. This allows multiple devices on the local network to share a single public IP address for accessing resources on the Internet. NAT modifies the source IP address of outgoing packets so that they appear to come from the public IP address of the router. It also keeps a translation table so that when responses come back from the Internet, it can send the response to the correct local machine.

2. **Stateful Inspection**: The router also performs stateful inspection of packets to ensure that they conform to established TCP sessions.

3. **ISP Backbone**: Finally, the border router sends the data packets to the ISP's backbone. AcmeCorp has contracts with multiple backbone providers for redundancy and high availability.

## Border Router

The border router serves as the gateway between the enterprise network and the Internet. It performs functions like NAT (Network Address Translation), stateful packet inspection, and firewalling to secure the network.

### IP Addressing
- Public IP: 203.0.113.1
- Private IP Range: 192.168.0.0/24

## Internal Subnets

The internal network is divided into multiple subnets to isolate traffic for various departments.

### Subnet Allocation

- Engineering: 192.168.1.0/24
- Marketing: 192.168.2.0/24
- Sales: 192.168.3.0/24

## VLANs

Each department is assigned its own VLAN to separate broadcast domains.

- Engineering: VLAN 10
- Marketing: VLAN 20
- Sales: VLAN 30

## DNS Servers

AcmeCorp has internal DNS servers for domain name resolution within the network.

- Primary DNS: 192.168.0.10
- Secondary DNS: 192.168.0.11

## Data Centers

AcmeCorp operates two data centers for high availability and disaster recovery.

- Data Center 1: Located in City A
- Data Center 2: Located in City B

## Backbone Providers

Multiple backbone providers ensure redundancy and high availability for the organization's internet connection.

- Provider 1: ISP-A
- Provider 2: ISP-B

## Firewalls

Firewalls are deployed at strategic points within the network to enforce security policies.

- Location 1: Between the Border Router and Core Switch
- Location 2: At the entry points of each department's network

## VPNs

Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) are used to securely connect remote users and offices to the enterprise network.

- VPN Server: 192.168.0.12

## Security Measures

- Intrusion Detection System (IDS) integrated with the border router to monitor suspicious activities.
- Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) to act upon any alerts generated by IDS.
- Network Monitoring system to oversee network performance and flag anomalies.

## Conclusion

This enterprise network architecture demonstrates how various components such as border routers, internal subnets, VLANs, and DNS servers can be integrated to create a scalable and secure network environment for a large organization. Additional features like data centers, backbone providers, firewalls, and VPNs further enhance its robustness and resilience.
