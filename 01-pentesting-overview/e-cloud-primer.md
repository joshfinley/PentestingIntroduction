# Cloud Computing Primer
Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services over the Internet, providing scalable and flexible access to resources like servers, storage, and software. Here's an overview of key cloud computing topics.

## Overview of Common Terms

| Category | Type | Description |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Deployment Models** | Public Cloud | Cloud resources are owned and managed by a third-party cloud service provider and made available to the general public. |
| | Private Cloud | Cloud resources are used exclusively by a single organization. The private cloud can be hosted either on-premises or at a third-party data center. |
| | Hybrid Cloud | A combination of public and private clouds, allowing data and applications to be shared between them. |
| **Service Models** | IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service) | Provides virtualized computing resources over the Internet. |
| | PaaS (Platform as a Service) | Provides a platform allowing customers to develop, run, and manage applications. |
| | SaaS (Software as a Service) | Delivers software applications over the Internet on a subscription basis. |
| | FaaS (Function as a Service) | Also known as serverless, allows developers to run code in response to events without managing servers. |
| **Key Concepts** | Virtualization | The technology that enables the creation of virtual resources (servers, networks, storage, etc.). |
| | Scalability | The ability of a system to handle increased load by adding more resources. |
| | High Availability | Systems are designed to be available and recover quickly from failures. |
| | Elasticity | The ability to automatically or manually scale resources up or down as needed. |
| | Multi-Tenancy | Multiple customers share common resources in a public or private cloud. |

## Deployment Models

### Public Cloud

Public clouds are owned and managed by third-party service providers. Customers benefit from economies of scale because the infrastructure costs are spread across all users, allowing each individual client to operate at a low-cost point.

#### Advantages:

1. **Cost-Effective**: No need to purchase and maintain hardware.
2. **Scalable**: Easily scale resources up or down based on demand.
3. **Flexible**: Choose from a variety of services that suit your needs.

### Private Cloud

Private clouds are used by a single organization. They offer more control over security, data, and quality of service but at a higher cost.

#### Advantages:

1. **Control**: Greater control over resources and security.
2. **Compliance**: Easier to comply with data sovereignty and other regulations.
3. **Customization**: The cloud environment can be tailored to specific business needs.

### Hybrid Cloud

Hybrid clouds combine public and private clouds, allowing data and applications to be shared between them. This offers greater flexibility and optimization of existing infrastructure.

#### Advantages:
1. **Flexibility**: Keep sensitive data on-premises while leveraging the public cloud for less-sensitive data.
2. **Cost-Effectiveness**: Maximize existing infrastructure while tapping into public cloud resources as needed.
3. **Scalability**: Scale resources up or down easily and quickly.

## Service Models

### IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)

IaaS provides virtualized computing resources over the Internet. It offers the basic infrastructure services, such as virtual machines, networking, storage, and the user has to manage the OS, applications, and data.

### PaaS (Platform as a Service)

PaaS provides a platform and environment to allow developers to build applications and services. This can include development tools, operating systems, and databases.

### SaaS (Software as a Service)

In SaaS, cloud providers install and maintain software in the cloud and customers can use the software from cloud clients. The service is usually provided on a subscription basis.

### FaaS (Function as a Service)

Also known as serverless computing, allows developers to run backend code without managing servers. It can save time and resources because you only pay for the compute time you consume.

## Key Cloud Concepts

### Virtualization

Virtualization is the fundamental technology that powers cloud computing. It allows multiple operating systems to share a single physical server.

### Scalability & Elasticity

Scalability is the ability of a system to grow and manage increased demand. Elasticity refers to the ability to automatically (or semi-automatically) scale resources up or down as required.

### High Availability

High availability ensures that services are available most of the time. This is often achieved through redundancy and failover capabilities.

### Multi-Tenancy

Multi-tenancy allows multiple customers to share common infrastructure and code base but still have their own segregated data and configurations.

## Security Considerations

Security in cloud computing is a vast topic that encompasses various aspects such as data protection, identity management, physical security, and more.

1. **Data Encryption**: Protects sensitive data during transmission and while it's stored.
2. **Identity & Access Management**: Ensures only authorized individuals can access specific resources.
3. **Firewalls**: Act as a barrier between your resources and potential threats.
4. **Compliance**: Make sure to understand the compliance requirements (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA) when storing and processing data.
   
Cloud computing has revolutionized the way businesses think about IT resources and technology. The flexibility, scalability, and cost-efficiency of cloud services make them a compelling choice for modern organizations.
