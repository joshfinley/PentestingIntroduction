# Lateral movement

Pivoting around the target environment to gain access to new systems, information, or targets.

- Types:
  1. **Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)**: Using RDP to move to other systems that allow this type of connection.

  2. **SSH Hopping**: If SSH is used within the network, one can move from one system to another using harvested or brute-forced credentials.

  3. **Pass-the-Hash**: Using a hashed credential to authenticate and move laterally to another system without requiring the plaintext password.

  4. **Pass-the-Ticket**: Similar to Pass-the-Hash but for Kerberos authentication.

  5. **WMI and PowerShell**: Using Windows Management Instrumentation or PowerShell for remote command execution.

  6. **SMB and File Shares**: Accessing shared files or directories and using them to move onto other systems.

  7. **Service Exploitation**: Exploiting vulnerabilities in network services to gain access to other systems.

  8. **Process Injection**: Injecting malicious code into running processes on other machines to execute commands.

  9. **Scheduled Tasks and Cron Jobs**: Scheduling tasks on remote systems to execute commands at specified intervals.

  10. **Application Deployment Software**: Utilizing systems like SCCM (System Center Configuration Manager) to deploy malicious software.

  11. **Living off the Land**: Using built-in system tools to move laterally to avoid detection.

  12. **Network Sniffing**: Capturing network packets to discover useful information like credentials for lateral movement.

  13. **Database Queries**: Using compromised databases to run queries that allow for lateral movement.

  14. **API Abuse**: Using application or service APIs to move laterally through a network.
